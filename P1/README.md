# CLEANER
This is a web game where the user must take on the role of a content moderator and filter out content from the internet. 

## Artist Statement
### Basis
This project has its basis in the documentary The Cleaners, which exposes how mega social media corporations keep their platforms clean (among other things). In short, they do so by outsourcing the work of content moderation to third-world countries. ‘Cleaners’ there are subject to some of the worst horrors of the internet and must continuously make calls as to whether to delete / censor content or to keep it up.

In this browser game, the user takes on the role of such a ‘cleaner’. Obviously, though I don’t want to subject people to what actual content moderators see (nor do I want to try and seek it out myself) and so the game takes on a much milder theme.

### Purpose
The point of this project is simply to remind users that this kind of content moderation exists and is necessary for us to enjoy platforms largely devoid of toxicity.

To further hint at the connection, I made sure to model the whole interface after what actual ‘cleaners’ are shown to use within the documentary.

### Content
Moreover, I believe that even if the displayed content was much milder, it was crucial to pull the content from an actual social media platform (Flickr in this case). This is quite akin to making training data sets for machine learning. It was crucial that I had almost no say in what image was being chosen (apart from the search tag, obviously). Had I created a selection of images to use, not only would the game have been memory intensive and quite limited, but the content would also display some bias making it non-representative of a real social media platform. 
Right now, I am happy with the kind of results the image fetching process results in. On top of that, the resulting images for each search seems to change as the Flickr database evolves, which further strengthens the connection towards real media platforms and therefore towards real content moderation.
