# Project Vector

Built off [template-p5-project](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/master/templates/template-p5-project) provided by [Pippin Barr](https://github.com/pippinbarr). Makes use of the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

Made as part of the Creative Computation II (CART 263) courseworks.
It is an entension of the previous version of 'Project Vector' that was made within the previous course (CART 253).

This is a platformer game with a focus on speed.
The goal is to navigate levels in the shortest amount of time possible.

## Artist statement

### Vision
In terms of play, the general aim of this project was to create a platformer game which encourages 'speedrunning'. In doing so, mastery of controls and mechanics would strongly come into play. Player movement would be fluid enough so that simply moving around an enviroment should be fun. Game mechanics would be intuitive enough not to require much explanation.


In terms of code, since the game runs on its own custom 'engine', the aim was to re-work it into something more organized, yet still malleable (as in new ideas can be implemented easily). I what I've made makes fairly good use of JavaScript's strengths as a programming languages (especially with being able to refer to functions using variables).



### Intended Experience & Design
Improvement is the key idea within this game's design. Ideally, the quantifiable "score" (time taken) given at the end of each level would motivate the user to achieve lower times. In doing so, they could come to gain mastery over the controls and mechanics as well as to understand level layouts and how to navigate them most efficiently.


This means that levels are to be replayed again and again until the user is satisfied with their performance. Because of this, the game's asthetics were chosen to express a relatively calmer tone rather than trying to appeal to the game's speed. 


Mastery over the game is meant to be satifying. I believe that being able to almost fly though levels effortlessly is the best feeling that this game can offer to its users.


Since mastery over the controls is such an integral piece of this game, 'input forgiveness' needed to be implemented.(This means that, for example, the player can still jump for a few frames after leaving a platform.) Always requiring pixel-perfect inputs would needlessly add difficulty and simply lead to frustration. In the same sense, allowing controls to be re-mapped removes the unnecessary challenge of potentially getting used to an arbitrary input scheme.


So much time has gone into designing and coding the game structure, unfortunately not much time was left for making levels.
